# Internship-blog-
There's so much stories to tell when you're a intern at i.c.stars! This work in progress blog features some great things that have happened when I was interning there. I am here to share my experience as what life as a cycle 3 intern was like! My internship project isn't done yet but I have been updating it often and I do often update my code as well. I can defiantly see a huge progress from the beginning of my uploads till now. I have used my profile before to upload the homework I have done for night school at i.c.stars and now I am going to be sharing more content of my own.
